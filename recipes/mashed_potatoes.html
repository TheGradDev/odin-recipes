    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an easy take on mashed potatoes. The potatoes pressure cook away while you focus on other things. This is a basic but tasty recipe that you can upgrade with your own ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>2 cubes of chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>Half cup sour cream</li>
        <li>Half cup unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut potatoes into 1-inch cubes. Add to a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant PotÂ®) with water and bouillon cubes. Select Saute function; set timer for 4 minutes on High.</li>
        <li>Mix potatoes and water and break up the bouillon cubes. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method. Remove the pot and carefully drain off most of the liquid.</li>
        <li>Add sour cream, butter, and milk. Gently mash with a potato masher to reach your desired consistency.</li>
    </ol>
